# Hunt Showdown - Toggle for Hunter control scheme

--Works only for Logitech mouses--



## Requirements

1. You need the Logitech G Hub. And if you also have a Logitech keyboard you can possibly improve this script even more.
2. Set aim down sight to hold and assign the buttons according to the script (o for aim down sight and l in the hunter mode)
3. Load the script to your Mouse with G Hub
4. Activate the script with Mouse button 6. You should also deactivate the script with that button while not playing as typing 'o' or 'l' constantly can be annoying. If you can't activate the script uncomment line 18 in the script and see which numbers your mouse buttons have. Then set `activate_script_button` accordingly.
